I developed a book query app that, when a title is put into the search bar, a form will be submitted that responds with the book title, author, publishing house and a brief description of the book. The design is focused around utility and minimalism.

 My inspiration was from Google's search page. The page is white space, a title, search bar and ancillary information in tabs about the page. I researched user-font reactions and color theory to best intrigue the user while keeping focus on the page's primary function.

 The code is structured around the API as a center piece. When a form is submitted, the API responds with the desired information. A modal is attached later to offer a short inspirational quote and a brief description on how to operate the site.
